    2. Sort them by Snowball method (smallest balance first)
    3. Sort them by Avalanche method (highest interest first)
    4. Recommend the best strategy with a clear reason
    5. Provide an action plan using the user's remaining balance as extra payment

    For credit_cards: use 'balance' and 'interest_rate' (or 'cat' for annual %).
    For debts: use 'total_remaining' as the balance.

    Always provide specific numbers and a clear recommendation.
